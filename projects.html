    <h1 class="cover-heading">Small game engine</h1>
      <p class="lead">
        I am currently working on a small game engine with the intention to create a simple 3D version of a tower defence game I made with friends at university.
      </p>
      <div class="text-center">
        <img src="assets/images/openglsand.gif" class="rounded" alt="OpenGLSanbox" width="100%">

      <a href="https://github.com/Jack-0/OpenGLSandbox" style="text-decoration:none; color:wheat">OpenGLSanbox</a> is that engine. 
        Currently very little is going on visually. 
        However, from many other attempts at projects I have learnt a thing or two about programming patterns and have implemented them into this small engine.
        In the past creating games using the OOP paradigm I have hit a brick wall with the deadly diamond of inheritance. 
        But no longer thanks to the implementation of an ECS which not only uncouples the spaghetti nature of inheritance but also can greatly improve performance. 
        I have also implemented a state machine to allow for different states such as a menu, game and pause. While doing this I have learnt a great deal about C++.
      </p>


    <h1 class="cover-heading">Other projects</h1>
      <p class="lead">
      <a href="https://github.com/Jack-0/HelloSDL" style="text-decoration:none; color:wheat">HelloSDL</a> 
        is my first attempt at multi-threading in C++. 
        Initially the project started as an attempt to make a small game with SDL, 
        but I wanted to experiment with improving performance and hence the implementation of a thread separate to the games thread that detects collisions. 
        Reviewing this code in it's current state makes me question the use of OOP and the lack of thread safety. 
        However the FPS increase on my old Thinkpad x220 could not be overlooked.

      <p class="lead">
      <a href="https://github.com/Jack-0/KnightOfFoo" style="text-decoration:none; color:wheat">KnightOfFoo</a> 
      is an attempt at porting a Java game I made for a university project into C++. 
      Unfortunately due to university commitments I never finished this project. 
      However it did prove to be a valuable use of time as it helped me improve my c++ and helped me recall concepts 
      I read in one of Bjarne Stroustrup C++ books before I attended university.
